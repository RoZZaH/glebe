    Glebe House, the home for nearly thirty years of the renowned artist Derek Hill, is situated on rising ground, beside Lough Gartan, east of Glenveagh National Park, Co. Donegal.</p>
    <p>Originally known as <i>St Columb’s</i>, the 1828 Regency-style house is decorated with <b>William Morris textiles</b>,
     and collections of Islamic and Japanese art, as well as <b>300 works by leading twentieth-century artists</b> such as Picasso and Kokoshka.</p>
    <p>The house and gardens are displayed in an informal manner, as though Derek Hill was still in residence.</p>
    <p><small>Glebe House and Gallery are operated and managed by the Office of Public Works.</small></p>
