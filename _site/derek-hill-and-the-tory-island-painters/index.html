## Intro (from house history)

Derek Hill was born in England in 1916.
He was educated at Marlborough College, where he showed an early interest in painting. However, he was persuaded by his father to concentrate on stage design and studied in Munich, Paris, Vienna and Russia. He returned to Paris in 1937 to paint and at the outbreak of World War II, Hill returned to England and, as a conscientious objector, volunteered for farm work. During those years, he met many of the leading British artists and began buying the works of painters of the Euston Road School.

In 1946, Hill was in to Ireland for a whole year, painting in Galway and Mayo. In 1949 he visited Italy, and, for the next five winters, he stayed in the home of the art historian Bernard Berenson outside Florence. ln Italy he also met Henry McIlhenny, who invited him to visit Glenveagh Castle. Hill visited in 1949 and 1951 and hearing that St Columb’s was for sale, eventually bought it in 1953.

Derek Hill re-converted St Columb’s into a home once more, with the help of his brother John, an interior designer and director of a design company. He added heating and electricity and converting the stable block into a studio and extra accommodation for his guests and housekeeper. Hill also began to create an informal woodland garden out of the previous working garden.


## Derek Hill

Arthur Derek Hill was born in Southampton in 1916 into a wealthy family.

He had two older brothers and like them he attended Marlborough College where he demonstrated an interest in, and a talent for, painting. His father persuaded him to study stage design rather than painting as that had greater prospects for employment. Consequently he enrolled to study stage design in Munich at the age of 17.

He later studied under Paul Colin in Paris and under Dr Josef Gregor in Vienna. Dr Gregor introduced him to Tairov, the director of the Mamemney Theatre in Moscow, where he spent six months in 1936. After working in Moscow he took time out to travel east via the Trans Siberian Express to Japan, China, Bali and Siam.

In 1937 Hill returned to England to a job as costume designer at Sadlers Wells but after a short time he went back to Paris. Encouraged by Edward Molyneux, a couturier and collector of impressionist art, he rented an old mill in the Loire and took up painting in earnest. When war broke out he returned to Wiltshire in England as a conscientious objector and worked as a farm worker. He still painted in his spare time and met many artists including Mary Kessell and Victor Pasmore.

In 1943, at the age of 27, Hill had a one man exhibition in London at the Nicholson Gallery and he also organised exhibitions of the work of other artists including Degas. In 1946 Hill spent a year painting in Ireland. He had relations in Co Wicklow but mostly painted in Galway, Mayo and Achill Island where he painted with the Irish artist Louis LeBroquey.

From 1947 Hill spent a great deal of time in Italy.
He met the art historian Bernard Berenson who admired his work and became a father figure to him following the death of his own parents. He spent many winters at Berenson’s home, the I Tati estate, outside Florence.

During his time in Italy he met many Italian artists including Antonio Music, Renato Guttuso, Bruno Saetti and Giorgio Morandi. He also met the American Henry McIlhenney, who was working at the American Academy in Rome. McIlhenney owned Glenveagh Castle in Donegal at the time and invited Hill to visit him there in 1949. Hill returned again and again to Donegal and in 1953 he bought the house the old St Columb’s rectory, now Glebe House, and moved in the following year.

Erskine Childers, President of Ireland, by Derek Hill, 1974. The National Museum. Oil on canvas. Erskine and Rita Childers stayed at St Columb's from where they visited Tory Island, touring it on the only mechanised form of trnasport: a tractor. Hill finished this picture, showing him visiting the local people he loved, after the president's death. Derek Hill Foundation. 
Glebe House was Hill’s main home from 1954 until 1981 although he continued to travel extensively during those years.
He was appointed the Art Director at the British School in Rome where he met such artists as John Bratby and Joe Tillson as well as the more famous Francis Bacon, Henry Inlander, John Craxton and Keith Vaughan.

In 1958 Derek Hill visited Tory Island for the first time and was fascinated by the light and rugged scenery. He rented a hut there and spent many weeks every summer painting. His example and encouragement led to the development of a whole school of naïve painting, the Tory Island Painters, of whom the best known artist is James Dixon

Hill’s career as a painter, particularly of portraits, blossomed and he was commissioned to paint many famous people some of whom visited St Columb’s. His portraits include those of Yehudi Menuhin, Arthur Rubenstein, Sir Michael Tippett, Wilfred Thesinger, Erskine Childers, Garrett Fitzgerald, Tony O’Reilly, Prince Charles, Lord Mountbatten, Laurens van der Post, Archbishop McQuaid and Cardinal Heard. His portrait of Anthony Eden is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London.

In 1982 Hill gave his home here at Lough Gartan and its contents to the Irish people. He bought a cottage nearby but moved his base to a family home in Hampstead in London. He continued to spend time in the Gartan area and on Tory Island until his death in London in July 2000.

Derek Hill was only in Donegal a few short years…
… when he made his way further west to Tory Island and to what was perhaps his most important contribution to Irish Art – his encouragement and patronage of the Tory Island artists and in particular James Dixon.

The story is often told that James Dixon had never painted before meeting Derek Hill but it’s not entirely correct. Dixon does appear to have claimed that he “could do better” after watching Derek painting on the island one morning but some of Dixon’s paintings pre-date that first meeting. What is true is that Hill was impressed by Dixon’s confidence and supplied him with paint and paper, encouraging him at every turn. Dixon’s masterpiece ‘West End Village’, a bird’s eye view of one of the two small villages on Tory, hangs in the kitchen at St. Columb’s.

Spurred on by James Dixon’s success, other islanders began to paint, the best known are Patsy Dan Rodgers (the King of Tory), Ruairí Rodgers and Anton Meenan, all of whom have painted consistently for many decades now.

These islanders artists have created a unique and fascinating record of their small community and Tory Island life for over fifty years. The Derek Hill Collection at the Glebe house contains some of the finest examples of Tory Island folk art.
