#### About the series

The RTÉ Radio 1 DAVIS NOW LECTURES 2019 present aspects of MAKING HOME by contributors renowned in their fields of ARCHITECTURE, HISTORY, TECHNOLOGY, ARTS and ECONOMICS.

At the heart of the DAVIS NOW LECTURES is the aim of bringing to audiences newly-commissioned lectures from our finest scholars, artists and thinkers. Five lectures are recorded on location around Ireland for future broadcast as hour-long edited programmes. Each event consists of a lecture, questions and remarks by an invited audience and then a public q+a session.

The series consultant editor is architectural historian Dr Ellen Rowley, of University College Dublin. The DAVIS NOW LECTURES 2019 series is supported by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and its academic partner is University College Dublin. The RTÉ Radio series producer is Clíodhna Ní Anluain.
