Following the widely acclaimed exhibition at IMMA and VISUAL Centre for Contemporary Art, Carlow, The Regional Cultural Centre and Glebe House and Gallery, present Patrick Scott: IMAGE SPACE LIGHT as a single exhibition across the two venues to bring to public attention the breadth and distinction of his career as an artist, designer and architect.

Scott’s unique vision has consistently pursued formal rigour and experimentation through the calibration of line, image, space and light. He is renowned as the first Irish exponent of pure abstraction. At The Regional Cultural Centre the second part of Scott’s career is presented with a display of the artist’s tapestries, a medium in which he is matched by few in the history of 20th century design, and a selection of superlative Gold Paintings ranging in date from the 1960s to the present day. Also at the RCC are examples of Scott’s folding screens, the Tables for Meditation, and various suites of work on paper including the Gestural drawings and the Meditations prints.

The paintings exhibited at Glebe House range across the naïve style birds in schematic landscapes of the artist’s White Stag related work during the 1940s, the urban and domestic inspired ‘structural’ compositions of the 1950s, the soaked canvases of the bog and lakeland ‘process’ paintings and the explosive beauty of poured and dripped painting in the Device works of the early 1960s. There is also an early example of the contemplative Gold Paintings that combine in infinite permutations the textures of raw canvas, white tempera and gold leaf, arguably Scott’s signature expression. The Glebe Gallery also includes Scott’s design work during the 1950s and 60s and works related to ROSC ’67.
