Con Lynch is a Sligo-based ceramicist. The pots in this exhibition are all recent works. They are made from clays and glazes Con collected in the North West of Ireland. The show is intensely beautiful.

Many of the pots are Raku fired. The term Raku, in Japanese, means ‘enjoyment’, ‘satisfaction’, or ‘comfort’. The word refers to a type of ware and also to an entire process and belief. It originated in the sixteenth century during the construction of a palace in Kyoto called Jurakudai. Before the mid-twentieth century American potters, working in Japan, had become familiar with the process of Raku firing and, on returning home, began experimenting with the fast firing and cooling. From these experiments grew the practice of contempory Raku.
