Sarah Lewtas has lived and worked in Co Donegal for over thirty years and has previously contributed to a number of exhibitions here at the Glebe Gallery. This is her first solo exhibition in this gallery and includes work produced over a period of years and in a variety of media – from drawing to video and from books bound in crow’s wings to sewn and quilted installations.
