This is the cartoon, or full-size study, for the centre light of a three light window (the other two showing The Saved and The Damned) in a private chapel in Warwickshire. Evie Hone grew up in County Dublin but studied in London and Paris, with Audré Lhote and then Albert Gleizes in the late 1920s. From them came her interest in Cubist and abstract art, which led almost inevitably to stained glass. In the 1930s and 1940s she undetook many commissions at the Dublin stained glass studios An Túr Gloine, while continuing to paint.
