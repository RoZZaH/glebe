Hokusai, one of the most prolific Japanese artists, produced over 30,000 drawings during a long life, at the end of which he described himself as ‘the old man mad about drawing’. This is one of his, and Japan’s most famous images, coming from the series called Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji which he worked on in the early 1830s.
