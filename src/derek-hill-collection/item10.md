Born in Palermo, Sicily, Guttuso studied law but abandoned it for painting, and became one of the leading Social Realist artists in Italy. As an active member of the Communist Party many of his paintings had specific political messages. Others are vivid portrayals of everyday life. This quick sketch, done in 1946, contains the same energy and spontaneity that Guttuso brought to his larger works.
