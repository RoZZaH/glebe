Pasmore was a founder of the Euston Road School in the 1930s, and until 1948 painted subtle landscapes and interiors hailed as the best since those of Whistler. Derek Hill met him during the war while working on a farm in Wiltshire, and was greatly affected by Pasmore’s approach to painting. He especially admired the underlying geometry which later, by the 1950s, became the basis for Pasmore’s work, as he abandoned representational art for abstraction.
