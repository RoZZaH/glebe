Picasso, best known for his paintings, was also a prolific producer of sculpture and ceramics. From 1947 he worked in the Madoura Pottery at Vallauris in southern France, making unique and limited edition ceramics. In the latter case Picasso made or designed an original for reproduction by assistants. Bullfight, from June 1950, is one of three such editioned pieces in the Derek Hill collection, bought by him at the Madoura Potter in the 1950s.
