Daily Guided Tours During Season
Join one of our knowledgeable guides for a tour of Glebe House that takes you from the early nineteenth century, when building commenced, right up to the present day. Hear the fascinating story of Derek Hill, and discover the incredible artwork of the Tory Islanders.

Access to Glebe House is by guided tour; these are available throughout the day when the house is open, and there is a maximum of fifteen people per tour. Groups of more than ten should contact us to book in advance. The average length of a tour is forty-five minutes. Photography and video is not permitted.

## Primary Pupils

A visit for primary level students can be used to support various aspects of the curriculum including:
Art, Craft and Design (investigate by looking; learn about artists; architects and designers from different periods; develop observational skills)
History (how people lived; the changes that took place over different periods and how people were affected by those changes; understanding local history and learning about evidence)
CSPE (appreciating our environment)
We provide worksheets for primary level students and these can be provided in advance of your visit here.

## Secondary Students
A visit to Glebe House can also be used to support aspects of the Leaving Certificate History curriculum.
Social and cultural history, and Leaving Certificate Art (design and craft work) are particularly relevant. Leaving Certificate Art students are also invited to visit our regular fine art exhibitions which will encourage students to develop an awareness of the importance of the visual arts in our culture and community.

We provide occasional art and craft workshops for children during school holidays and during Heritage Week. Check here or on our Facebook page for details. We are also happy to assist students who are carrying out research on local history, art and architecture.
